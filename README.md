Detects food items from an image using Clarifai and suggests 3 recipes using a recipe API.

## Project Overview
This project allows users to upload an image of food, and it uses the Clarifai Food Recognition model to detect ingredients or food items in the image. Based on the detected items, the app fetches three recipe suggestions using an external recipe API, helping users find meal ideas based on what they have.
